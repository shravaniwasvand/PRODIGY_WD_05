TASK 05- Web Application
This is a Weather Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It integrates the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data. Users can search for any city and view current weather and forecast. This project demonstrates my skills in API integration and frontend development.
